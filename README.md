# community-routes

This idea was brought up in [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikepacking/comments/11kej2n/communitycollaborative_route_builder/) so this is an attempt to build something workable that allows a community route builder, using open source software.

This is just a proof of concept right now.
